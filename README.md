# Algorithm-in-C
Popular Algorithms written in C++.
Here is a quick summary of what you can see here:
- **Common Data Structures**
  * Heap Data Structure.  Sometimes C++ STL Data Structure may not perform according to your program need so use this  explicitly to modify accroding to your program needs.
- **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Randomized Algorithms**
  * Quick Select Sort
    * Runs on linear time in expectations.
- **Graph Algorithm**
  * Depth First Search/ Breadth First Search if used Queue
  * Djikstra Algorithm Implementations
  
- **Useful Algorithm**
  * Rabin-Karp Algorithm. Has better runtime in expectation than naive algorithm. KMP Algorithm is even more better than this.
